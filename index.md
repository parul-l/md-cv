## Experience

`November 2019 - Present` 
__WW International (formally Weight Watchers)__, Data Scientist  

Developed and deployed a sentiment model that analyzed user generated text from WW's social platform. This work is used internally to gauge customer reactions to product changes. 

Integrated WW's experimental testing service into the data science team's code base. Ran and analyzed an A/B test to determine the effects of personalization on meal preparation.

Contributed to the team's execute workflow framework, [primrose](https://github.com/ww-tech/primrose), by adding new GCS caching capabilities, implementing additional ML model training facilities, and adding a slack notification feature.

Provided WW coaches with aggregates of member related statistics, such as weight/food/sleep tracking, user engagement, top posts, and member demographics  to help inform them of their audience and the effects of their content.  

<br>
`January 2018 - February 2019` 
__Vituity__, Data Scientist

Developed and deployed an unsupervised learning model that groups US hospitals based on size, location, and composition, allowing medical directors to appropriately benchmark performance.

Built statistical models predicting patients in need of specialized attention to enhance physician practices and patient care.

Designed and implemented an algorithm to integrate data sources with no common keys using geocodes.

Created ETL jobs that gathered data from third party services and ingested them in the department database.

<br>
`August 2013 - August 2017` 
__Bronx Community College, City University of New York__, Assistant Professor, Mathematics

Published research in quantifying energy loss by light near a rotating black hole.

Taught various undergraduate level courses, such as Linear Algebra and Probability and Statistics.

Supervised undergraduate research projects on general relativity and digital signal processing.database.


<br>
`August 2012 - August 2013` 
__Drexel University__, Visiting Assistant Professor

Taught advanced undergraduate level courses, including Partial Differential Equations and Linear Algebra.

Collaborated on projects that characterized light paths near rotating black holes.database.


<br>
`September 2011 - June 2012` 
__University of Cambridge__, Postdoctoral Fellow

Published results on light wave dispersion outside of non-rotating black holes.

Studied mathematical systems related to general relativity with an emphasis on theoretical analysis of black holes.

## Projects

`2016 - 2019`
__Team Chemistry Analyzer for NBA__

Used statistical learning to assess how well a random group of NBA players will play together. This was done by building an NBA play simulator using player position data.

Created a model that predicts each player's passing, moving, and shooting habits using player position data.

Scraped NBA data to determine the correlation between team revenues, player costs and winning percentages.

Assessed individual player contributions by analyzing team winning percentages before and after trades.
